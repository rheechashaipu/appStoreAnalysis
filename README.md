# appStoreAnalysis
The imaginary business goal is to analyze the iOS App Store and Google Play markets and come up with a profitable app profile for an imaginary firm that specializes in producing freemium apps for English language users.

The personal goal for this project was to just get my hands dirty with Python, Jupyter, and data cleaning. I could've used Python libraries to handle all my data cleaning and analysis but I first wanted to simply use plain Python before developing a sense of reliance on tools such as pandas and numpy. I'm not sure if I'll return to this project anytime soon.
